# TarkovMarket-Bot
EFT Flea Market bot

This is a program that contacts Escape From Tarkovs servers through a Javascript api to detect when items are placed at a lower price than average.

The bot will purchase items at a low price and sell them at a higher price to make in game profits.

This will read your login info from a text file named info.txt in the same directory as test.js, so create that file and format it as below
